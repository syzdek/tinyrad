.SH DESCRIPTION
 To be written.

.SH RETURN VALUES
\fBtinyrad_array_get\fR() returns \fINULL\fR if an error occurs, otherwise a
pointer to the object is returned. \fBtinyrad_array_search\fR() returns -1 if
an error occurs, otherwise the index position of the requested object is
returned.
.sp
Upon success, \fBtinyrad_array_insert\fR() and \fBtinyrad_array_remove\fR
return the index position of the object added to or removed from the
array, otherwise -2 is returned if a memory error occured and -1 for all
other errors.
